## Getting Started

To start using Convert.js in your web project, follow these simple steps:

1. **Include the Library:**
   Add the Convert.js library to your project. You can either download it from the repository or include it via a CDN link.

   ```html
   <!-- Example using CDN -->
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/NiqueWrld/Convert.js@main/conv.js"></script>
   ```

2. **Initiate Convert.js:**
   Initialize Convert.js in your JavaScript file.

   ```javascript
   // Example initialization
   const jsonConverter = new jsonToObject();
   ```

3. **Perform Conversions:**
   Use the library's functions to perform the desired conversions.

   ```javascript
   // Example JSON string
   const jsonString = '{"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}';

   // Convert JSON string to JavaScript object
   const jsonObject = jsonConverter.convertToObject(jsonString);
   ```
   
 4. **Check Success:**
    Check if the conversion was successful

    ```javascript
    if (jsonObject !== null) {
        console.log("JSON converted to object:", jsonObject);

        // Now you can access properties of the object
        console.log("Name:", jsonObject.name);
        console.log("Age:", jsonObject.age);
        console.log("City:", jsonObject.city);
    } 
    else {
        console.log("JSON parsing failed. Check the error message for details.");
    }
   ```
